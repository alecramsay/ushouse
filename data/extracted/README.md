These are the revised data capture spreadsheets that create the inputs for the impute_election.py script.

* The official results by state are collected on the *Election Results by State* tab.
* The official results for each uncontested race are collected on the *Uncontested Races* tab.
* The *Uncontested PIVOT* tab is vestigial and should be deleted.
* The *RESULTS* and *UNCONTESTED* tabs format the input for exporting.
