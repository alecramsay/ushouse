# README

These are the old spreadsheets that captured (extracted) the raw data from the Clerk of the House reports. They also started the processing, by aggregating uncontested results by state. 

In contrast, the spreadsheets in the parent folder only capture the raw data. They then export it to two files (RESULTS and UNCONTESTED) which are the inputs to the impute_election.py script.
