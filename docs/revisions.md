# REVISION HISTORY

I took snapshots of all the previous work (on 12/18/22), so I can make changes if necessary and compare results.

## 2000â€“2016 Elections

I did these all at roughly the same time several years ago.
 
2000 election:
- AR / 3rd -- No (blank) uncontested data. 
- LA / 2nd -- Ditto
- LA / 3rd -- Negative "other" votes. WTF?!? <<< TODO

2002 election:
- FL / 10th, 12th, 14th, 21st -- No uncontested data (blanks). R wins (CONFIRMED).
- FL / 11th, 20th -- Ditto, but D wins (CONFIRMED).
- NY / 5th, 18th, 23rd -- large fragmented "other" vote used (CONFIRMED).

2004 election:

## 2018 & 2020 Elections

I did this more recently, after a long time away from the spreadsheet and much file reorganization:

2018 election:
- Vote totals don't validate on the Results tab, because I included [special election results for the 9th](https://ballotpedia.org/).North_Carolina%27s_9th_Congressional_District_special_election,_2019
- FL / 10th, 14th, 21st, 24th -- No uncontested data (blanks). D wins (CONFIRMED).
- NC / 3rd -- Negative "other" votes. <<< FIXED: The total vote was erroneously zero.
- TODO: Export RESULTS & UNCONTESTED

2020 election:
- TODO: Export RESULTS & UNCONTESTED

## 2022 Election

I'm going this now ...

## Uncontested Cases

- 2018 / WI / 2nd -- actual votes > 0.7 average contested vote
