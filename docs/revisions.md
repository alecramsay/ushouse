# REVISION HISTORY

I took snapshots of all the previous work (on 12/18/22), so I could make changes if necessary & compare results with my original spreadsheet-based workflow.

## 2000â€“2016 Elections

I processed these elections at roughly the same time several years ago.
 
2000 election -- Reviewed automated results.
- AR / 3rd -- No uncontested data (blanks). R win. 
- LA / 2nd -- Ditto. D win.
- LA / 3rd -- Negative "other" votes. <<< FIXED: The total vote was missing a leading '1'

2002 election -- Reviewed automated results.
- FL / 10th, 12th, 14th, 21st -- No uncontested data (blanks). R wins
- FL / 11th, 20th -- Ditto, but D wins
- NY / 5th, 18th, 23rd -- fragmented "other" vote > winner <<< CONFIRMED : TODO -- Write test case

2004 election -- Reviewed automated results.
- Several uncontested races with no votes reported.
- NY / 25th -- fragmented "other" vote > winner <<< CONFIRMED : TODO -- Write test case

2006 election -- TODO: Spot check results
- Several uncontested races with no votes reported.
- The `OTH1` (Column F) formula in the IMPUTED spreadsheet is wrong--doesn't include the R vote. It's right in the EXTRACTED spreadsheet. This affects every uncontested R win (ugh). This is probably the result of the R/D columns being reversed and trying to update the formulas for that. <<< FIXED by using the EXTRACTED data <<< TODO
- TX / 22nd -- fragmented "other" vote > winner <<< CONFIRMED : TODO -- Write test case

2008 election -- TODO: Spot check results
- Several uncontested races with no votes reported.
- The `OTH1` (Column F) formula in the IMPUTED spreadsheet is wrong--doesn't include the R vote. Same as above. <<< TODO
- AL / all 4 races were uncontested -- So, no AVG contested vote. Used Presidential total (271,654) as a proxy. 
- VT at large district was uncontested -- So, no AVG contested vote. Used the Presidential total (325,046) as a proxy.

2010 election -- Reviewed automated results.
- Several uncontested races with no votes reported.
- NY / 29th -- fragmented "other" vote > winner <<< CONFIRMED : TODO -- Write test case

2012 election -- Reviewed automated results.
- Several uncontested races with no votes reported.

2014 election -- Reviewed automated results.
- Several uncontested races with no votes reported.

2016 election -- Reviewed automated results.
- Two uncontested races with no votes reported.
- ND at large district was uncontested -- So, no AVG contested vote. Used the Presidential total (344,360) as a proxy.

## 2018 & 2020 Elections

I processed these more recently, after a long time away from the spreadsheet and much file reorganization:

2018 election -- Reviewed automated results.
- Vote totals don't validate on the Results tab, because I included [special election results for the 9th](https://ballotpedia.org/).North_Carolina%27s_9th_Congressional_District_special_election,_2019 <<< OK
- FL / 10th, 14th, 21st, 24th -- No uncontested data (blanks). D wins <<< TODO -- Investigate: Not included in manual results?
- MI <<< TODO -- Investigate
- NC / 3rd -- Negative "other" votes. <<< FIXED: The total vote was erroneously zero : TODO -- Write test case

2020 election -- Reviewed automated results.
- MA / 1st, 3rd, 7th, 8th uncontested races erroneously coded as R vs. D wins (CONFIRMED). <<< FIXED
- FL <<< TODO -- Investigate
- SD at large district was uncontested -- So, no AVG contested vote. Used the Presidential total (422,609) as a proxy.

## 2022 Election

I'm going this, when the Clerk of the House releases the official results.

## Special Test Cases

- 2006 / AL / 6th -- non-winning imputed votes > winning
- 2006 / TX / 22nd -- fragmented "other" votes > winning
- 2016 / MN / 2nd -- imputed > actual
- 2018 / WI / 2nd -- actual votes > 0.7 average contested vote
