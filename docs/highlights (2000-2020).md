# Highlights (2000-2020)

In this past (2012-2020) redistricting cycle:

- The number of states that typically delivered proportional delegations in a given election was roughly half (12%, 6 states) what it was the previous decade (23%, 11).
- Moreover, 23 states (46%) always skewed R, and
- Another 11 (22%) always skewed D
- While just 15 (30%) sometimes skewed R and sometimes D, and
- Only 1 (CO) always delivered a proportional delegation

TODO: Net unearned seats: 2012-2016 vs. 2008

The minority party (i.e., less than half the two-party vote) controlled the House twice: 2000 and 2012.
