# Highlights (2000-2020)

Where did congressional maps get redrawn after 2012 and before 2020 election?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_States_redistricting_cycle

- FL 2015 (redrawn 12/02/15) -- Affected the 2016, 2018, and 2020 elections. It doesn't seem to have made much of a partisan difference--maybe a seat.
- PA 2018 (adopted 02/19/18) -- Affected the 2018 and 2020 elections. This had a ~3-seat effect favoring D's.
- NC 2019 (struck down 09/03/19) -- Affected the 2020 election. This had a 2-seat effect favoring D's.

Noticeable changes over the decade:

- CA went bluer in 2018 (~4 seats favoring D's) <<< TODO: What happened?
- MI went proportional (2 seats bluer) in 2018 and 2020 -- R's Mike Bishop (8th) and Dave Trott (11th) lost to Elissa Slotkin and Haley Stevens, respectively.
- VA flipped blue in 2018 and 2020 (net 3 seats favoring D's) -- R's Scott Taylor (2nd), Dave Brat (7th), and Barbara Comstock (10th) lost to Elaine Luria, Abigail Spanberger, and Jennifer Wexton, respectively.
- D's won 53.54% and 51.08% of the national vote in 2018 and 2020, respectively <<< TODO: Was this enough to make up the difference in aggregate performance?

Trends:

- R UE seats averaged 23 2002-2010, but then jumped averaging 42 2012-2016 with the new maps. <<< REDMAP
- At the same time, D UE seats averaged 23 2002-2010 and stayed that way with the new maps 2012-2016.
- Then in 2018-2020, R UE fell back to 32 <<< TODO: What happened?
- And D UE increased to 36 <<< TODO: What happened?

- The number of states that typically delivered proportional delegations in a given election was roughly half (12%, 6 states) what it was the previous decade (23%, 11).
- Moreover, 23 states (46%) always skewed R, and
- Another 11 (22%) always skewed D
- While just 15 (30%) sometimes skewed R and sometimes D, and
- Only 1 (CO) always delivered a proportional delegation

The minority party (i.e., less than half the two-party vote) controlled the House twice: 2000 and 2012.
